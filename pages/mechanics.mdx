# Evo Mechanics

Evos are the core of EvoVerses, each with unique attributes, abilities, and battle strategies. Understanding their mechanics is essential for mastering the game.

## Evo Species & Rarities
Evos come in different species, each belonging to a specific type with strengths and weaknesses. Rarities affect their availability and the prestige of owning them but do not impact stats or abilities:
- **Common** â€“ The most widely available Evos.
- **Chroma** â€“ A visually distinct variant, rarer than Common but functionally identical.
- **Epic** â€“ The rarest Evo variant, offering exclusive visual designs and high prestige among collectors.

## Attributes & Stats
Every Evo has a set of attributes that determine its performance in battle:
- **Health (HP)** â€“ Determines how much damage an Evo can withstand before fainting.
- **Attack (ATK)** â€“ Influences the damage dealt by offensive moves.
- **Defense (DEF)** â€“ Reduces damage received from enemy attacks.
- **Special Attack (SP.ATK)** â€“ Determines the power of special moves.
- **Special Defense (SP.DEF)** â€“ Reduces damage received from special moves.
- **Speed (SPD)** â€“ Determines the order of turns in battle.

## Type Effectiveness
Each Evo belongs to one or more elemental types, which interact dynamically in battles:

- Types include **Air, Bug, Corrupt, Dark, Earth, Ether, Fire, Light, Mineral, Monster, Plant, and Water**.
- Some types have advantages over others, dealing increased damage.
- Certain types resist or are immune to specific attacks, reducing damage taken.
- A well-balanced team accounts for type matchups to counter opponents effectively.

## Training & Evolution
Evos can grow stronger through training and evolution:
- **Training** â€“ Gain experience and improve stats through battles and special training activities.
- **Evolution** â€“ Some Evos can evolve into more powerful forms after meeting specific conditions, such as reaching a level threshold or using a special item.

## Special Abilities
Special abilities are not innate but can be obtained through various items and consumables such as potions, medallions, and other resources. Once acquired, these abilities provide passive or active effects in battle and can:
- Boost stats under certain conditions.
- Provide immunities or resistances.
- Trigger effects based on the Evoâ€™s actions or the opponentâ€™s moves.
