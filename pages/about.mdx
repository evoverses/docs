# About EvoVerses: Team & Philosophy

## The Journey Forward

In August 2023, the current EvoVerses Executive Team took over the project after a period of development inactivity caused by the bear market and lack of funds. Spurred by the impending shutdown of Boba on Avalanche, the new leadership is committed to revitalising the project and delivering an engaging game for users to enjoy.

## Management Philosophy

EvoVerses is now being operated as a commercial entity. A company will be established in a suitable jurisdiction, with the executive team holding major shares and the original founders retaining a minor stake in the business.

Our guiding principles include:
- **Commitment to Success**: As new owners, we are dedicated to making EvoVerses a long-term success.
- **Transparency and Honesty**: Building and maintaining trust with our community through open communication.
- **User-Centric Approach**: Prioritising the enjoyment and satisfaction of our users in every aspect of the game.

## Experience & Expertise

The EvoVerses leadership team brings together diverse expertise:
- **Technical Development**: Proficiency in bleeding-edge technologies and coding practices.
- **Gaming & Crypto Marketing**: Deep understanding of gaming communities and blockchain ecosystems.
- **Business & Project Management**: Decades of real-world experience managing projects and contracts across multiple industries.

We leverage each other's strengths to propel the project forward effectively.
