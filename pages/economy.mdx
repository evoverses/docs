# Game Economy & Tokenomics

EvoVerses operates on **EVO**, the core token of the ecosystem, providing utility across the game. EVO is used for purchasing assets, entering tournaments, breeding, and staking, ensuring a balanced in-game economy.

## EVO Token Overview

<Callout>
    üîó **Avalanche Token Address**: [0x42006Ab57701251B580bDFc24778C43c9ff589A1](https://snowtrace.io/address/0x42006ab57701251B580bDFc24778C43c9ff589A1#code)
</Callout>

EVO exists natively on the **Avalanche blockchain** and may be bridgeable to other chains in the future if expansion occurs. Transactions involving EVO generate fees, which are allocated for **staking rewards**, **development funding**, and **ecosystem sustainability**.

### Ways to Acquire EVO
- **Purchasing on a Decentralised Exchange (DEX)** http://bit.ly/4hCWIhe
- **Winning tournaments** with token prizes
- **Staking liquidity in the liquidity pool (LP)**
- **Future in-game rewards and events**

### Ways to Use EVO
- **Purchases**
- Ecosystem NFTs
- In-game items
- Battle Passes
- **Breeding new Evos** *(feature available but paused)*
- **Staking in liquidity pools** to earn rewards
- **Tournament entry fees**

## In-Game Economy & Marketplace
An **in-game marketplace** allows players to buy and sell:
- **Evos and eggs**
- **Trainers and outfits**
- **Power-ups and consumables**
- **Aesthetic and limited-edition collectibles**

Evo NFTs are also available for purchase on **OpenSea** and **JoePegs**, providing unique ownership opportunities for players.

## Evo Breeding System *(Paused but Implemented)*
Breeding allows players to create new Evos by combining two parent Evos. Each newly bred Evo inherits certain traits from its parents and belongs to a **generation** based on the following system:

- **Gen 0 Evos** ‚Äì These are the originally minted Evos and have unlimited breeding potential.
- **Generation Progression** ‚Äì When two Evos breed, the offspring‚Äôs generation is determined by the highest generation of the two parents +1. (e.g., Two Gen 0 parents will produce a Gen 1 Evo, whereas a Gen 0 and a Gen 1 parent will produce a Gen 2 Evo.)
- **Breeding Limits** ‚Äì Gen 0 Evos have unlimited breeding, but all other generations are limited to producing **5 offspring**.
- **Breeding Costs** ‚Äì The cost to breed increases based on the number of times an Evo has bred and the generation of the parents. However, Gen 0 breeding costs plateau after 5 breeds.
- **Cooldowns** ‚Äì Each Evo must wait for a cooldown period after breeding before it can breed again.

Because of these mechanics, **Gen 0 Evos are highly sought after and valuable** due to their unlimited breeding potential and lower long-term costs.


## Staking & Liquidity Pool
A liquidity pool is available for **staking EVO tokens**, allowing holders to earn emissions while supporting the game‚Äôs economy. Staking rewards are dynamically adjusted to balance sustainability and engagement.

## Token Distribution
EVO is unlocked on a pre-determined schedule, with an initial circulating supply of **76,000,000 EVO (12.67% of total supply)**.
