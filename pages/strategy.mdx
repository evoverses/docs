# Competitive Play & Strategy

EvoVerses thrives on competition, offering dynamic player-versus-player (PvP) gameplay that rewards strategy, adaptability, and skill. Here’s everything you need to know to climb the ranks and dominate the battlefield.

## PvP Mechanics & Matchmaking
- **Turn-Based Battles**: Matches are turn-based, requiring careful planning and tactical decisions to outwit opponents.
- **Health Management**: Each turn, players must carefully monitor their Evos’ health to ensure survival in battle. Potions and other consumables can be used to regenerate health during or between battles.
- **Move Points (PP)**: Each move an Evo can perform is limited by its PP, which determines how many times the move can be used. PP can be replenished with specific items similar to health regeneration.
- **Matchmaking System**: Players are matched based on skill levels, ensuring fair and challenging battles.
- **Ranked and Unranked Modes**: Practice in unranked matches or test your mettle in the competitive ranked ladder.
